    <h1>Notes on Uniform Resource Identifiers</h1>
    <p>
    The ultimate reference (maybe?):
    <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986">

    </p>

    <p>
    RFC 3986 gives some advices on several pitfalls:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        A 'resource' pointed by a URI does not necessarily have to be an
        electronic document of some kind; it can literally be anything.
        (e.g., human beings, corporations, books, math equations, etc.)
      </li>
      <li>
        An identifier does not necessarily define or embody the
        resource by itself (but it could; e.g., query strings)
      </li>
      <li>
        The system that uses the identifier does not necessarily access the
        resource pointed by that identifier.
      </li>
      <li>
        An identifier may be pointing to multiple resources (e.g., DNS-based
        load balancing), and the resource it points to might change (e.g., DNS
        registry changes).
      </li>
    </ol>
